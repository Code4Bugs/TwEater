# TwEater
A Python way to collect **MORE** Tweets and their **REPLIES** from Twitter than the official API.
Currently only **Python 2.7.x** is supported.

The motivation is to collect tweets for **Text Mining** or NLP tasks, such as message understanding, talking bot, opinion Mining, information extraction, event detection & tracking, tweet ranking, and so on.

Therefore, not only the tweet text and basic attributes, but also **conversations**, **emojis**, links, mentions, hashtags are all necessary to be able to collected by it.

Also, official API imposes limits on time and amount of the tweets you can collect, try TwEater!

## Examples
Look into the **eater.py**, it's a simple example of using this bot.
First, you need place your order either by a configuration file, or by **K=V** parameters:
```
TwOrder.order('order.conf')
```
Or
```
TwOrder.order(user='BarackObama')
```
Two methods **digest_2_file** and **digest_2_mongo** are provided to process data after collecting them, either store them in a file or in a MongoDB, or even process them on the fly, it's up to you. You can define **your own** processing function.

Then, go harvest tweets together with replies (emojis are also collected, very important for sentiment analysis):
```
TwEater.eatTweets(digest_2_file, 'test')
```
If you just want get the replies of someone's `username` some tweet `tweet_id`, this will return a json array.
```
print TwChef.shopComments('BarackObama', '876456804305252353')
```

## Parameters
The example values for the 9 parameters is as follows, which can be seen from file `order.conf`:
